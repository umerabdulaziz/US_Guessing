This is an interactive **U.S. States Guessing Game** built with Python!  
It uses **Turtle graphics** for the map and **Pandas** for handling state data.  

Technologies Used
- **Python **
- **Turtle (for GUI)**
- **Pandas (for data processing)**
- **CSV file handling**

## 📌 How It Works:
1️⃣ A blank U.S. map appears.  
2️⃣ The player types in state names.  
3️⃣ Correct guesses are displayed on the map.  
4️⃣ At the end, the program saves the **missing states** to `states_to_learn.csv` for practice.  

pip install pandas
